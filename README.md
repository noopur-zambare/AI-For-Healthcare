# AI-For-Healthcare

AI has emerged as a revolutionary force in healthcare, revolutionising the business in a variety of ways. Its incorporation into numerous aspects of healthcare has the potential to improve patient outcomes, streamline operations, and increase overall care quality.

## Project Overview

We conducted clinical research in this project to analyse and categorise mandibular (jaw) motions during the act of eating. The major goal was to use machine learning approaches to increase the accuracy of these categorizations, which could have consequences for a variety of healthcare applications such as dietary assessments, speech therapy, and oral health monitoring.


## Key Highlights

- **Data Enhancement**: We ran into data constraints, but we overcame them by using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to expand our dataset. We were able to improve the resilience and performance of our models as a result of this.

- **Machine Learning Models**: We experimented with various ML algorithms to categorize mandibular motions during eating. Our results were as follows:
    - Liquid Neural Networks (LNN): Achieved an accuracy of %.
    - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Achieved an accuracy of %.
    - k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Achieved an accuracy of %.
